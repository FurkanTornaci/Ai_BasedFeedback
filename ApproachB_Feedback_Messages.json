Every seafarer, regardless of experience level, encounters challenging areas in COLREGs, and assessments like this are valuable learning opportunities. Your willingness to engage with these questions is a strong first step toward improving.\n\nMany of the questions you answered incorrectly relate to fundamental rules, such as the correct maneuver in a head-on situation (Rule 14: both vessels should alter course to starboard), and how to identify a vessel constrained by her draft (displaying three vertical red lights). It's also important to be familiar with sound signals in reduced visibility and to interpret situations using radar alone — for instance, turning to starboard when risk of collision is present (Rule 19).\n\nI recommend revisiting the definitions and rules around vessel types, responsibilities between vessels, and lights and shapes (Part A and C of the COLREGs). Studying these again in the context of real-world examples will help reinforce your understanding.\n\nStay motivated — mastering these rules takes time and consistent practice. Focus on one section at a time, and don’t hesitate to use visual aids or simulations to better grasp vessel behavior.
