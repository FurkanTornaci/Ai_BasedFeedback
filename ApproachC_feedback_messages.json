  "Q1": {
    "question": "The term 'power-driven vessel' refers to any vessel __________.",
    "correct_answer": "with propelling machinery in use",
    "feedback": "A power-driven vessel, as per Rule 3 of the COLREGs, is defined as any vessel with propelling machinery in use. It is important to remember that this rule helps differentiate between vessels that are powered by machinery versus those that are not. To recall this concept, think of a power-driven vessel as one that relies on its engines for propulsion. Understanding this distinction will help you correctly identify and interact with vessels in different situations on the water."

  "Q2": {
    "question": "A vessel 'restricted in her ability to maneuver' is one which __________.",
    "correct_answer": "from the nature of her work is unable to maneuver as required by the rules",
    "feedback": "A vessel 'restricted in her ability to maneuver' is one that, by the nature of her work, is unable to maneuver as required by Rule 3 of COLREGs. This means that the vessel may have limited or impeded ability to change course or speed to avoid collision. Remember that vessels engaged in special operations such as dredging, surveying, or laying cables are often considered restricted in their ability to maneuver. Keep this in mind to help you identify these vessels in the future."

  "Q3": {
    "question": "Which statement is TRUE, according to the Rules?",
    "correct_answer": "A vessel engaged in fishing while underway shall, so far as possible, keep out of the way of a vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver.",
    "feedback": "The correct concept is that a vessel engaged in fishing should keep clear of a vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver, as per Rule 18 of the COLREGs. Remember, keeping a safe distance from vessels with restricted maneuverability is crucial for the safety of all involved. This rule helps prevent potential accidents and ensures smooth navigation in shared waters. Keep this in mind for future reference on the water."

  "Q4": {
    "question": "When two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on and there is a risk of collision, which action is required to be taken?",
    "correct_answer": "Both vessels alter course to starboard",
    "feedback": "When two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on and there is a risk of collision, Rule 14 of the COLREGs requires both vessels to alter course to starboard. This maneuver allows the vessels to pass each other port side to port side, reducing the risk of collision. Remember, the key takeaway is always to take immediate and decisive action to avoid a potential collision situation at sea. Keep this rule in mind to ensure safe navigation in such scenarios."
  },
  "Q5": {
    "question": "Which describes a head-on situation?",
    "correct_answer": "Seeing both sidelights of a vessel directly ahead",
    "feedback": "In a head-on situation, as per Rule 14 of the COLREGs, both sidelights of a vessel should be visible directly ahead. This means you should see both the red and green lights. Remember, when encountering this situation, it is important to take early and decisive action to avoid a potential collision. This will help ensure safe navigation and adherence to maritime regulations."
  },
  "Q6": {
    "question": "Your vessel is underway in reduced visibility. You hear the fog signal of another vessel about 30Â° on your starboard bow. If danger of collision exists, which action(s) are you required to take?",
    "correct_answer": "Reduce your speed to the minimum at which it can be kept on course",
    "feedback": "In accordance with COLREG Rule 16, if there is a danger of collision in reduced visibility, you must reduce your speed to the minimum at which your vessel can be kept on course. This allows you to have more time to assess the situation and take necessary evasive action to avoid a collision. Remember, slowing down in reduced visibility is crucial for the safety of both vessels involved."
  },
  "Q7": {
    "question": "You have sighted three red lights in a vertical line on another vessel dead ahead at night. Which vessel would display these lights?",
    "correct_answer": "A vessel constrained by her draft",
    "feedback": "The three red lights in a vertical line seen on a vessel dead ahead at night indicate that it is a vessel constrained by her draft, as per Rule 28 of the COLREGs. Remember, these lights are a clear indication of a vessel that is limited in its ability to maneuver due to its draft. Keep in mind this specific light configuration next time you encounter a similar situation at sea. Keep up the good work in learning and understanding maritime rules."
  },
  "Q8": {
    "question": "By radar alone, you detect a vessel ahead on a collision course, about 3 miles distant. Which action should you take?",
    "correct_answer": "Turn the vessel to starboard",
    "feedback": "When detecting a vessel ahead on a collision course by radar alone, the correct action is to turn your vessel to starboard. This is in accordance with Rule 14 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). Remember, turning to starboard allows for a better chance of avoiding a collision and following the rules of the road at sea. Practice this maneuver during your training sessions to improve your skills and response time in similar situations. Great effort!"
  },
  "Q9": {
    "question": "A vessel may exhibit lights other than those prescribed by the Rules as long as the additional lights meet which requirement(s)?",
    "correct_answer": "do not impair the visibility or distinctive character of the prescribed lights",
    "feedback": "When displaying lights or shapes under the COLREGs (Rule 20), it is important to ensure they do not impair the visibility or distinctive character of the prescribed lights. Remember, the purpose of displaying lights and shapes is to communicate essential information to other vessels for safe navigation. Pay attention to details such as placement and brightness to ensure they are effective in conveying the intended messages. Keep practicing and paying attention to the guidelines to improve your understanding of this important rule."
  },
  "Q10": {
    "question": "What sound signal is used by a power-driven vessel making way in fog?",
    "correct_answer": "Continuously sounding the fog whistle",
    "feedback": "In accordance with Rule 35 of the COLREGs, a power-driven vessel making way in fog must continuously sound the fog whistle. This helps alert other vessels of your presence and navigate safely during limited visibility conditions. Remember, when in doubt, it's always better to err on the side of caution and use sound signals to communicate effectively with other vessels. Keep practicing to reinforce this important safety procedure."
