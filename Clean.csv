It’s clear you’ve made solid progress in building your understanding of the COLREGs. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from some extra review to strengthen your overall comprehension. Many of these topics are fundamental to safe navigation, and gaining a clearer grasp of them will enhance your confidence and decision-making skills at sea. 
A key area for improvement is understanding essential definitions, such as what constitutes a ‘vessel’ and the meaning of ‘restricted visibility.’ These definitions lay the foundation for interpreting the rules correctly. Additionally, clarifying the concept of ‘safe speed’—which factors influence it and why it is essential—will help in making sound navigational judgments. Another important focus is vessel responsibilities, particularly when determining who gives way in crossing and overtaking situations, as well as which vessels a power-driven vessel must keep clear of. Similarly, reviewing the proper conduct of fishing vessels in traffic separation schemes will help in applying the rules effectively in congested waters. Navigation signals and lights also require further attention, particularly the sound signal used when unsure whether a vessel is overtaking, the meaning of ‘sternlight,’ and when specific lights and shapes must be displayed—including the shape for a tow exceeding 200 meters. 
As you continue your training, focus on these key areas and take the time to review relevant COLREGs sections carefully. Pay close attention to practical examples and real-world applications of the rules to strengthen your understanding. Approach your studies with an open and proactive mindset—these are common challenges, and with practice, they will become second nature. Keep building on your progress, and remember that mastering these principles is essential for safe and effective navigation. You have the ability to improve, and with dedication, you’ll gain greater confidence in applying the COLREGs at sea. ",Human
