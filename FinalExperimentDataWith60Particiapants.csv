Question: By radar alone, you detect a vessel ahead on a collision course, about 3 miles distant. Your radar plot shows this to be a meeting situation. Which action should you take?
Feedback: ""A"" is correct â in a meeting situation, both vessels should turn to starboard to pass safely port-to-port.

Question: A vessel may exhibit lights other than those prescribed by the Rules as long as the additional lights meet which requirement(s)?
Feedback: ""A"" is correct â additional lights may be shown if they do not impair the visibility or character of prescribed ones.

Question: Your vessel is underway in reduced visibility. You hear the fog signal of another vessel about 30Â° on your starboard bow. If danger of collision exists, which action(s) are you required to take?
Feedback: ""A"" is correct â reducing speed to the minimum required to maintain course allows time to assess and react safely in limited visibility.

Question: Which signal should be used to indicate that your vessel is in distress?
Feedback: ""D"" is correct â continuous fog whistle blasts indicate a vessel in distress in restricted visibility.",

Question: Which describes a head-on situation?
Feedback: ""C"" is correct â seeing both sidelights of another vessel means you're on a direct collision course (head-on).

Question: Your vessel is underway in reduced visibility. You hear the fog signal of another vessel about 30Â° on your starboard bow. If danger of collision exists, which action(s) are you required to take?
Feedback: ""A"" is correct â reducing speed to the minimum required to maintain course allows time to assess and react safely in limited visibility.

Question: A vessel may exhibit lights other than those prescribed by the Rules as long as the additional lights meet which requirement(s)?
Feedback: ""A"" is correct â additional lights may be shown if they do not impair the visibility or character of prescribed ones.

Question: By radar alone, you detect a vessel ahead on a collision course, about 3 miles distant. Your radar plot shows this to be a meeting situation. Which action should you take?
Feedback: ""A"" is correct â in a meeting situation, both vessels should turn to starboard to pass safely port-to-port.

Question: A vessel may exhibit lights other than those prescribed by the Rules as long as the additional lights meet which requirement(s)?
Feedback: ""A"" is correct â additional lights may be shown if they do not impair the visibility or character of prescribed ones.
